# Bird migration
## Track your favourite species of birds across time! 


Query your bird in the front-end and see where groups have been spotted. The query will be forwarded to [Observations](https://observation.org/) and it's responses will be parsed and forwarded to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)'s API.
Using Java servlets, an interactive map will be displayed, showing all observations since its first occurence. Each occurence is a clickable object which will display the info and notes by the spotter.
